We're accepting talk proposals in the following topics/forms:

- Personal pet project (Hobby sharing/get support/propser)
- Professional experiences (Experiences sharing)
- Best practices (Knowledge sharing)
- State of XYZ (Informational sharing)

Note that talks should avoid covering implementation details and instead focus on concepts applicable in any language/platform. An example of such a topic would be *"Authentication mechanisms"*, instead of *Authenticating in Golang*.

Have something you'd like to say? Drop us a note at [this Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTBLl07WIucsnd3ixnKtpIgOR4sKVjdTg2t9qcynnXSxYgFQ/viewform) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!

Alternatively, if you're looking to talk about a commercial product you're developing locally, we'd also [love to hear from you](mailto:the.engineroom.sg@gmail.com).
