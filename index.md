## Questions we hope to answer

1. How can I have a chat with other technology professionals in a facilitated environment?
2. Where can I find other local technology hobbyists to collaborate with on open-source projects?
3. Is there a technical meetup with sharings that aren't in the context of any language/platform?
4. How can I find out more about engineering practices in other local companies?

We had these questions too (we hope we're not weird - join us to assure us xD)

**P.S.** Looking to speak? Check out [our guidelines](/speak) and submit an overview of your talk!
