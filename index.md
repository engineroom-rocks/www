# Welcome to EngineRoom SG

> A social meetup for professionals in code.

# Questions we hope to answer

You should definitely drop by if any of these questions ring true with you:

1. How can I have a chat with other technology professionals in a facilitated environment?
2. Is there a technical meetup with sharings that aren't in the context of any language/platform?
3. Where can I find other local technology hobbyists to collaborate with on open-source projects?
4. How can I find out more about engineering practices in other local companies?

We had these questions too (we hope we're not weird - join us to assure us xD)

# If we had a cookie to cut...

If you can say any of the following about yourself, we'd like to catch up with you at our meetup:

1. I create APIs
2. I craft UIs
3. I design UXs
4. I automate things
5. I lead/guide/direct a technical team
